# Crowdfunding_ETL

Instructions to run files:

Run the Jupyter Notebook file "ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code."

Once the Jupyter Notebook file is completely run through, CSV files titled "campaign", "category", "cleaned_contacts" and "subcategory" will be produced and saved to the "Resources" folder.

    Note: Option 1 - Using Pandas to create the contacts DataFrame was used.

Launch pgAmdin 4 and create a "crowdfunding_db" database.

Open the "crowdfunding_db_schema.sql" file in pgAdmin 4.

Run each of the four "Create Table" commands to create the tables within the schema. Import the respective CSV files from the Resources folder. 

Run the Select commands as written at the end to show the data output.
